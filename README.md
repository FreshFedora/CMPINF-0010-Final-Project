**Datasets**
1. https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/non-traffic-citations - non-traffic citations for allegheny county, includes harassment, property damage, littering, etc. 
2. https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2 - list of neighborhoods by size, borders, and other information 
3. https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh - traffic count data for the city of pittsburgh
4. https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-walk-scores - allegheney county walk scores by census tracts, 2010. Uses several sub-metrics such as distance to amenities and population density to generate a score from 0-100, with 100 being a walkers paradise and 0 being impossible to walk in
5. https://pitt.libguides.com/uscensus/pghcensustracts - list of census tracts for each neighborhood in pittsburgh by year. Useful for determining which census tracts belong to which neighborhood for datasets that use census tracts


This is an analysis of three submetrics to determine which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is best for jaywalking. It is meant for fun and we hold no responsibility for anything people do with this aggregated info.
